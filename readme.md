## Notes

Here I write some __notes__ that I consider important for the understanding of these `dotfiles`.

### Current Tiling Window Manager

I'm using the [`Amethyst`](https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst) __tiling window manager__, though I'm trying to transition to [`yabai`](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) at the present moment. The `yabai` tiling window manager requires the following: `.yabairc`, `.skhdrc`. Thus, I include them in this __repository__, although they are still _work in progress_. I plan to __fully__ switch to `yabai` in the future. 

### `macOS` & `unix`

I plan to create a __branch__ with configurations that are compatible with `unix` (not only `macOS`).
